## **Data Privacy & Security** ##
***


Data security and privacy are two elements that always factor when it comes to any technology; more so, when it comes to GenAI. The data used in GenAI processes should be obtained legally, and legal measures should also be exercised by GenAI on the data and the content it produces to be compliant with the prevailing laws.

Additionally, sourcing quality data is also challenging since many organizations experience issues with purchasing commercial licenses for current data or creating detailed datasets that could be used to generate generative models. This process should be exercised to avoid any issues that may arise regarding infringement on ownership of ideas.

Others draw concerns from the necessity to protect the information, which is usually personal or sensitive. Since generative AI systems rely on large sets of data to train the models, appropriate measures should be taken to ensure that the information does not end up with the wrong persons or organizations or is mishandled. It may lead to data leakage, which is often involving confidential information; a factor that raises the question of how to anonymize the data to prevent identification of individuals. It should be also explained to the users how their data will be used and ask permission before utilizing the data to train the GenAI model. As a result, organizations must regulate how such information is dealt with, while at the same time cultivating the openness of their business.

Moreover, concerns can also comprise adversarial attacks or even the manipulation of content generated by AI. Some applications depend on accurate and reliable content, such as technical documentation; therefore, it is important to maintain the authorship and authenticity of generative AI models.
