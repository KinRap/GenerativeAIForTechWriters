## **Lack of Creativity** ##
***

While GenAI has demonstrated remarkable outcomes, it lacks creativity in various tasks. It relies on technical writers to provide prompts, and if the prompts are incorrect, the resulting content will not meet the necessary quality standards. Additionally, GenAI often sounds robotic compared to human writers because it cannot pick up on certain language nuances.

As a result, it synthesizes content based on its input data but struggles to produce novel or innovative ideas. These tools rely on existing data and patterns, limiting their ability to create new concepts and solutions. GenAI is most effective for product descriptions, technical specifications, and other content generated from user input data. However, it is far from optimal for creative areas like marketing and advertising.

GenAI tools interact with datasets, language, and patterns, which can result in routine and sometimes plagiarized outputs. Unfortunately, most tools cannot produce anything genuinely creative. Plagiarism has serious legal ramifications because it is unlawful to use copyrighted materials without the owner's approval. Without professional plagiarism control, there is a higher probability of copying others' work or encountering copyrighted publications.

Technical writing also demands creativity to deliver appropriate information clearly and concisely to capture readers' attention. It focuses on wayfinding, storytelling, appropriate language, and content relevance. Compared to humans, GenAI cannot think beyond the provided data and create content that is both practically useful and emotionally engaging. For readers, this may result in texts that are overly similar, trite, and unoriginal, which do not captivate or attract. Sentiment analysis reveals that GenAI is unable to establish an effective emotional appeal to the readership.

In its broadest sense, creativity is a multi-faceted and enduring human characteristic that entails finding relationships and providing unique insights. It includes the capacity to join ideas, feelings, and events and connect them meaningfully to people. These aspects of creativity and adaptability remain challenging for generative AI systems, which may produce content that meets technical requirements but lacks the finesse and originality achieved by human writers.
