## **Generating ideas** ##
***

Sometimes, when starting a project, we have no idea where to begin, what to do, or how to approach it. To kickstart the process, we need to know the purpose of the document, who its audience is, and whether any previous work has been done on the subject. Every writer, including technical writers, can experience creative blocks and the dreaded blank page syndrome. Some see Generative AI as a threat to traditional writing methods, while others view it as a potential solution to the fear of the blank page. In such instances, GenAI can serve not only as a tool for finding information or checking spelling and grammar but also as a brilliant resource for unlocking creativity, generating ideas, and brainstorming.

### Brainstorming ###

GenAI tools can ignite creativity at the outset of a writing endeavor. Utilize GenAI to brainstorm potential topics for your writing assignments. Use topic-related keywords to refine your focus or formulate research inquiries. However, we must always remember the company's policy and data privacy regulations. For example, GenAI can assist us in brainstorming when developing a content strategy. However, for it to be genuinely useful, we must ensure high precision in the prompts used. Context is crucial because AI can generate different results based on the variables we input. The more specifics we provide to GenAI, the better chance we have of receiving helpful ideas. It's essential to provide the subject matter, the purpose of the text, and the personas to whom it is targeted. In your prompt, you can specify the format your document should take and how it should be delivered to the audience. You can also specify the style, tone, and perspective for the text, although some of these elements may need to be guided by GenAI.

### Resources ###

GenAI can provide us with information and show us sources that can help us come up with ideas about where to start. However, it is important to remember that using publicly available GenAI often does not allow us to verify the source from which the artificial intelligence retrieved the information. This is different when it comes to closed data sources, which can help us find information that has already been vetted in our company on a given topic. This can not only influence the overall idea of the project we are working on but can also save us a lot of time and prevent data duplication.

### Examples ###
You can ask GenAI to generate a sample documentation outline or plan for a specific text. The generated response can serve as inspiration for writing. While it requires critical thinking, it can serve as an ideal starting point for further work.

At times, beginning work requires a little spark or a fresh perspective. With GenAI, we can gain ideas to kickstart or advance our tasks.
