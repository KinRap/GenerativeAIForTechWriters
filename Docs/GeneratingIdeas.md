## **Generating Ideas** ##
***

Every writer, including technical writers, can experience creative blocks and the dreaded blank page syndrome. At times, beginning work requires a little spark or a fresh perspective. With GenAI, we can gain ideas to kickstart or advance our tasks.

### Brainstorming ###

Utilize GenAI to brainstorm potential topics for your writing assignments. Use topic-related keywords to refine your focus or formulate research inquiries. However, for it to be genuinely useful, we must ensure high precision in the prompts used. Context is crucial because AI can generate different results based on the variables we input. The more specifics we provide to GenAI, the better chance we have of receiving helpful ideas. It's essential to provide the subject matter, the purpose of the text, and the personas to whom it is targeted. In your prompt, you can specify the format your document should take and how it should be delivered to the audience. You can also specify the style, tone, and perspective for the text, although you can let some of these elements to be guided by GenAI.

### Resources ###

GenAI can provide us with information that help us get started. However, publicly available GenAI often does not allow us to verify the source from which the artificial intelligence retrieved the information. This is different when it comes to GenAI with closed data sources, which can find information that has already been vetted in our company.

### Examples ###

You can ask GenAI to generate a sample documentation outline or plan for a specific text. While it requires critical thinking, it can serve as an ideal starting point for further work.
