Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) are a list of frequent questions and their corresponding answers related to a specific topic, product, service, or organization. The purpose of an FAQ section is to provide quick and accessible information to users, addressing typical concerns, issues, or inquiries they might have. This helps to reduce the need for direct customer support by offering readily available solutions and information. FAQ sections are often found on websites, in user manuals, or in other informational materials.
