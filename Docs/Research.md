## **Research & Fact-Check** ##
***

Accurate data and facts are essential for maintaining the integrity of a technical document. To get the best results from GenAI, begin with clear and precise prompts. Use an iterative process to refine the responses, asking follow-up questions for more detailed or specific information. Always document the sources of information and data obtained through GenAI, and attribute information correctly to maintain transparency and credibility. Finally, review the information provided by GenAI for accuracy and relevance, using your expertise to interpret and integrate the data appropriately into your writing. This approach will ensure that all information you use is thoroughly fact-checked.

GenAI models can be useful for technical writers in researching and fact-checking, especially if they have access to a wide range of information and sources. However, a problem may arise with completely new technologies that the model has not been trained on before. In such situations, manual adjustments or additions to the documentation may be necessary to ensure its accuracy and completeness. In these cases, the knowledge and experience of a human editor may still be necessary.
