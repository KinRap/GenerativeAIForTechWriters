## **Create Logical Flow** ##
***

The concept of "logical flow" in writing encompasses all elements that facilitate smooth transitions for the reader from one sentence to the next, and from one paragraph to another. Clear and structured technical documents are essential for ensuring ease of understanding. A good document structure is crucial for users. If a document is poorly organized, it can confuse and frustrate readers, regardless of the quality of the information provided.
