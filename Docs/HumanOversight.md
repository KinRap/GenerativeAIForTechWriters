## **Human Oversight** ##
***

It is not possible to create automated technical content with GenAI and immediately publish it as a finished product without human review. 
If the company policy allows, technical writers can use GenAI as a virtual assistant. GenAI can analyze patterns, but understanding nuances and strategic alignment are best handled by humans. Domain-specific terminology requires human expertise, as do accuracy and relevance of the content.

Human intervention is necessary at every stage when using GenAI, from preparing training data (where a custom AI solution is in use) to reviewing the output for domain-specific accuracy. Content generated by GenAI must be checked for potential inaccuracies or "hallucinations," and a thorough understanding of the broader context is essential.

Technical writing requires close collaboration with subject matter experts (SMEs) to gather knowledge and ensure content accuracy. This human element is key to creating content that is not only technically accurate but also user-friendly and culturally relevant. SME is accountable for a final and comprehensive review of the documentation. GenAI can  assist SMEs by supporting tasks such as version comparison. It can make updates based on clear instructions, but the final decision on incorporating feedback rests with humans.

Complex text and image structures also require the human eye. GenAI can suggest layouts, but the final design often benefits from human touch. The expertise and design sensibility of human writers remain indispensable in the publication process, not only for graphical or visual reasons, but also due to the nuances of different file formats. When integrated with publishing platforms, GenAI can initiate publishing commands, but human oversight is necessary in other cases.
