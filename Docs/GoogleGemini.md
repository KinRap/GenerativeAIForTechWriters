Google Gemini is a family of AI models. They can understand and generate text like a regular  **Large Language Model (LLM)**, but they can also natively understand, operate on, and combine other kinds of information like images, audio, videos, and code.

### Features: ###
-	Multimodal reasoning analyses and comprehension of technical documents that combine text, code, and diagrams.
-	Draft generation which creates initial drafts of explanations, procedures, or comparisons based on your prompts.
-	Text editing and rewriting for improved clarity, flow, and sentence structure in existing technical documents.
-	Style adaptation of the tone and style of your writing to suit different audiences. 
-	Targeted search for specific information within technical documents or code repositories.
-	Brainstorming ideas, which provides a list of relevant talking points to overcome writer's block and develop comprehensive technical content.
-	Summarizing complex topics by making them easier to understand.
-	Identifying relevant information to pinpoint specific details within technical data.
-	Technical knowledge integration to ensure the generated content is accurate.
-	Translation and language understanding.

-	Integration with Google Services.

### Plan ###

We can use Google Gemini for free. But there are paid Google products that offer access to Gemini's functionalities, like <a href="https://workspace.google.com/pricing" target="_blank">Google Workspace</a> or <a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/gemini/code-assist?hl=pl" target="_blank">Gemini Code Assist</a>:
