ChatGPT is constantly evolving and can be used to create conversational tones, answer frequently asked questions, and even draft technical articles. GPT, also known as Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a language model that employs deep learning techniques to produce natural text. In addition to text, it can generate code, stories, poems, and much more. These distinguishing features have made GPT an important subject in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.

In May 2024, OpenAI announced ChatGPT-4o, their flagship model which seeks to improve communication between people and computers across various modalities by accepting and generating textual, audio, image, and video inputs and outputs. It can reply to audio inputs in as little as 232 milliseconds, with an average reaction time of roughly 320 milliseconds, which is quite close to human reaction time. Compared to GPT-4o Turbo, it has a similar level of proficiency in English and coding and significantly outperforms it for non-English text, while being 50% cheaper and three times faster. It also shows improvements over existing models in terms of vision and audio recognition capabilities.

Regarding personal use, work assignments, and other requirements, the conventions that Chat GPT-4o offers are valuable attributes that enhance its application.
