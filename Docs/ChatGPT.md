ChatGPT is constantly evolving and can be used to create conversational tones, answer frequently asked questions, and even draft technical articles. GPT, also known as Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a language model that employs deep learning techniques to produce natural text. In addition to text, it can generate code, stories, poems, and much more. These distinguishing features have made GPT an important subject in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.

In May 2024, OpenAI announced GPT-4, their flagship model that can reason across audio, vision, and text in real time, as described in the article 'Hello GPT-4' “GPT-4o (“o” for “omni”) is a step towards much more natural human-computer interaction—it accepts as input any combination of text, audio, image, and video and generates any combination of text, audio, and image outputs. It can respond to audio inputs in as little as 232 milliseconds, with an average of 320 milliseconds, which is similar to human response time in a conversation. It matches GPT-4 Turbo performance on text in English and code, with significant improvement on text in non-English languages, while also being much faster and 50% cheaper in the API. GPT-4o is especially better at vision and audio understanding compared to existing models”.

Regarding personal use, work assignments, and other requirements, the conventions that ChatGPT-4o offers are valuable attributes that enhance its application.
