## **Components of a prompt** ##
***

We already know what prompt design is and what benefits it brings. We have learned the best practices and strategies. However, to create effective prompts, we need to understand what they consist of and how to construct them precisely.

A prompt encompasses the following elements:

-	**Instruction**: A clear task or directive intended for the model to execute.
-	**Context**: External information or additional context provided to guide the model towards more accurate responses.
-	**Input Data**: The input or question for which a response is sought.
-	**Output Indicator**: Specification of the desired type or format of the output.

A prompt can contain more elements. Some of them may be crucial for achieving the desired response.
