Copilot is an AI software addition designed by Microsoft. It is a conversational chat interface that allows users to search for specific information, write emails, summarize content, and generate images from text prompts.

Copilot relies on AI, Bing's vast web-scraping database**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Text to Speech (TTS)** for creating natural speech responses, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for grounding and contextualizing responses, and **Azure Cloud** services.

A unique feature of Copilot in Windows is its ability to perform administrative operations, such as changing the color mode to dark, adjusting the volume, or enabling Do Not Disturb mode. It can also summarize or dictate text selected on your Windows desktop.

With a paid subscription, you can utilize Copilot in Microsoft 365 apps.

For developers, Copilot offers code suggestions, autocompletes code, and provides contextual recommendations. It is compatible with most built-in development tools and various programming languages.
